        <p className="card-text">
          This is the newest iteration of Starlight developed using
          Python 3, Flask, React, Booststrap 4 and Webpack. Essentially, Starlight is
          a web app front end (a client) for managing instances of AtHomeLED and AtHomeDMX.
        </p>
        <p className="card-text">
          Starlight can manage two different types of lighting controllers:

          >
            &nbsp;AtHomeLED&nbsp;
          </a>
          and
          <a
            className="card-link-x"
            href="https://gethub.com/dhocker/athomedmx"
          >
            AtHomeDMX
          </a>.
          AtHomeLED is a controller for LED strings based on WS281X or APA102 LEDs. AtHomeDMX
          is a controller for DMX lighting systems.
